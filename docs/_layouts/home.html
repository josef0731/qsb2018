  <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
  <br>
  <p>
  Biological systems are complex, out of equilibrium, processes that manage to sustain life in the ever increasing entropy of the universe. Despite much of the success evolution has achieved in creating reproducible templates for life, there is still room for error at multiple levels. Any errors could lead to diseases affecting all facets of life processes: examples include an immune system turnning on its host, proteins misfolding and aggregation, or uncontrolled cell proliferation leading to tumour formation. The advent of molecular profiling and health data infrastructures have enabled large-scale modelling and data analysis, as an emerging approach to understand the nature and regulation of biological phenomena. This workshop will focus on theoretical and computational modelling approaches applied in biology, in order to gain an insight into why living systems might fail and how we can design protocols that have the potential to prevent, or correct, any failings. We will discuss a wide range of topics ranging from computational biophysics to evolutionary dynamics, from cellular regulatory networks to the analysis of multidimensional molecular profiling data.
