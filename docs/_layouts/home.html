  Biological systems are complex, out of equilibrium, processes that manage to sustain life in the ever increasing entropy of the universe. Despite much of the success evolution has achieved in creating reproducible templates for life, there is still room for error at multiple levels. When a biological process fails to perform its expected function the results can be catastrophic. Examples of such failure include: an immune system turnning on its host, proteins misfolding resulting in disease and uncontrolled cell proliferation leading to tumours. This workshop will focus on theoretical and computational modelling of molecular and cellular biology, in order to gain an insight into why living systems might fail and how we can design protocols that have the potential to prevent, or correct, any failings. The key biological themes of the workshop will be preventing errors that lead to disease or genetic disorders in protein aggregation, regulatory networks and cellular decision making.
